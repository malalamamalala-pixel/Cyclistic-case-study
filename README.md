# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

## 📌 Business Task
Cyclistic wants to convert casual riders into annual members.  
To support this goal, I analyzed trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently.

## 📊 Data Sources
- 12 months of Divvy/Cyclistic trip data (2019 Q1 + 2020 Q1).
- Public data provided by Motivate International Inc.
- Cleaned in Excel (ride_length, day_of_week, null handling).

## 🛠️ Process
- Removed invalid ride lengths (<1 min, >24h).
- Standardized columns across datasets.
- Built PivotTables in Excel for descriptive analysis.
- Created visualizations in Excel and PowerPoint.

## 🔑 Key Findings
- Casual riders: longer rides, mostly weekends, seasonal peaks.
- Members: shorter rides, mostly weekdays, steady year-round.
- Clear difference: leisure vs. commuting.

## ✅ Recommendations
1. Market memberships as cost-saving for weekday commuters.
2. Launch seasonal promotions targeting casual weekend riders.
3. Use digital upsell campaigns (in-app + email).
4. Introduce weekend/short-term membership options.
5. Partner with companies/universities for discounted memberships.
